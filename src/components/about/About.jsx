									<h1>Welcome to my about page</h1>
									<p>
										My name is Dipen, I am a Frontend and
										backend developer based in Gujarat,
										india ‚õ∞Ô∏èüëã
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										Highly dedicated, self-motivated, and
										enthusiastic Python Programmer with 2 yr
										of experience in writing and executing
										Python code for web in frontend and
										backend development
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										I started doing daily programming
										practices back in March 2020, and since
										then I started working as a full stack
										developer in a Company.
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										I have been working as a freelance
										backend developer and front-end
										developer since 2021. I‚Äôve always been
										someone who has both a creative and a
										logical side. When I started learning
										frontend in college, I realized it would
										be the perfect fit. I could use my
										creative side to make interective
										website and my logical side to code. As
										a bonus, being both frontend and backend
										developer allows me to make sure no
										detail is lost in translation.
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										I specialize in creating websites for
										individuals and small businesses. You
										shouldn‚Äôt have to settle for cheap
										solutions or generic templates. I
										provide custom websites at afforable
										prices. Frequently your website is the
										first impression your customers will
										get, so make sure it‚Äôs a good one. Since
										my time is split between a few different
										things, I‚Äôm not able to take on every
										project I‚Äôd like to, but I'm always
										looking for fun work. Take a look at my
										portfolio, if you think I‚Äôd be a good
										match than click button below.
